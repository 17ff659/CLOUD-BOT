Anti-Anti-Automation Framework
====================
####SUMMARY####
This project springs from a profitable experimental proof that Rob Ragan and Oscar Salazar began, demonstrable through the summaries on:
http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/08/08/mining-cryptocurrency-free-cloud-botnet/
http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-07/25/mining-botnet-in-amazon-cloud.

as described in the illustrated booklet downloadable from:
http://www.syscan360.org/slides/2014_EN_CloudBots_RobRaganOscarSalazar.pdf,
http://www.slideshare.net/rob.ragan/cloudbots-harvesting-crypto-currency-like-a-botnet-farmer.

After, they have generated 1,000 Accounts, multiplying the result. All this was done when the Litecoin still showed greater margins profit due to an Index of difficulty lower than the present current. The Experimental Test was shown by them in the video of the prestigious Black Hat conference in 2014 and on:

A framework for techniques to bypass common anti-automation security controls.

#TO DO#
On such premises, I ask the Creation of a User-Friendly Software with Robotic Opening of various accounts on different Free Cloud, that allows the implementation of the operations listed below and the installation of the following softwares:

1. Choose the Public IP Address of the Free Cloud where to open the Account.
2. Choose the number of the Account we want to open on a specific Free Cloud. For istance: 10, 100, 1.000, 10.000, etc.
3. Verify the Open Account and what is the Public IP Address.
4. Allow the insertion of dummy data to enable the recording:
- Email Address Confirmation.
- Captcha.
- Phone/SMS Verification to confirm the Operation of the Account Opening.
- Credit Card Number
5. Allow you to enter the number of Credit Cards valid if some Free Cloud do not accept numbers Generated in Automatic, see below: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sL603xkfEDZ4p_WyRxp0vVu1lHz7fvrfvrqvFGILiqA/view?pli=1#gid=532821686.
6. Choose the Operating System to use: Debian, Ubuntu, MAC, Windows, ecc.
7. Installing Anti Anti-Automation downloadable from: https://github.com/BishopFox/anti-anti-automation.
8. Choose the CPU Miner to be installed in each Account:
- On Platform Linux Debian for the LTC: http://pastebin.com/3HQG8fb3, reported on the booklet prapared by researchers, page 31.
